# TabCollector
A browser extension that collects a list of open tabs, then closes them to save resources.
Currently it is just a Chrome version, but we hope to create a FireFox version as well.

## Installation
It is currently not on the extension store - just follow these instructions:
1. [Download](https://github.com/pw-64/TabCollector/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract (or clone) the repo
2. Open [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
3. Enable Developer Mode
4. Click Load unpacked
5. Provide the chrome_extension folder

## Screenshots
### It is in active development so these will change
