# Building
If you would rather build from source than use the provided packed files in [Releases](https://github.com/pw-64/TabCollector/releases) then follow these instructions:

1. Please use a linux-based system such as MacOS, Ubuntu, ...
2. Clone the repo
3. `cd building`
4. `bash 1-build.sh`

Since I cannot release the private keys, you will have to use your browser to load the unpacked build. I recommend you research the steps for your specific browser. For some like Chrome, you can load the folder. For others, you may need to run a command on the build folder to produce a file.
